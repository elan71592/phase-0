      <h3 class="first-heading">Version Control</h3>
      <p>Version control records and stores changes to a project over time. There are many benefits to using version control such as ablity to revert back to a previous version of your work if a mistake has been made in an update, recover work in case of loss or failure, share your work with others, and compare different versions of your work.</p>

      <h3 class="second-heading">Git & GitHub</h3>
      <p>Git is a very powerful tool used for keeping track of changes. It works by constantly keeping a log of what you do to your files. It's a local repo on your computer that knows what changes you've made to your files and then allows you to push them up to a cloud based repo which would be GitHub. So let's say I have a repo called cats and in that repo I have a file called index.html. If I go in and edit that file on my computer, git knows about it so when I'm done editing it, I can tell git that I would like to commit my changes to the file. This kind of creates a timestamp for that file with a message that I write to keep track of what I did to that file so that the person working on it next will be able to understand what changes I made and where he can continue on. Then I push those changes to GitHub (the cloud based repo) and BADABING BADABOOM! The other members of my team can continue to work on it!</p>
