      <p>Version control records and stores changes to a project over time. There are many benefits to using version control such as ablity to revert back to a previous version of your work if a mistake has been made in an update, recover work in case of loss or failure, share your work with others, and compare different versions of your work.</p>

      <h3 class="second-heading">Git & GitHub</h3>
      <p>Git is a very powerful tool used for keeping track of changes. It works by constantly keeping a log of what you do to your files. It's a local repo on your computer that knows what changes you've made to your files and then allows you to push them up to a cloud based repo which would be GitHub. So let's say I have a repo called cats and in that repo I have a file called index.html. If I go in and edit that file on my computer, git knows about it so when I'm done editing it, I can tell git that I would like to commit my changes to the file. This kind of creates a timestamp for that file with a message that I write to keep track of what I did to that file so that the person working on it next will be able to understand what changes I made and where he can continue on. Then I push those changes to GitHub (the cloud based repo) and BADABING BADABOOM! The other members of my team can continue to work on it!</p>

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

  - We used section as an HTML5 tag here. I find it useful and often use it to split things up.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

  - Elements get laid out on the page in order of importance starting with the invisible data that tells the browser how to read the code and what external files to include followed by the main body code that makes up the structure of the page.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

  - I think the both of us learned the power of sublime is in shortcuts and being able to code quickly. Sublime provides a lot of useful keyboard commands that automagically fill things in for you. We personally used a package for Sublime called Emmet so we won't be making any snippets anytime soon I think.
