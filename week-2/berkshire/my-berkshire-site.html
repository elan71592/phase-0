<!--
What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

  - It was simple and quick. It was also nice to refresh my memory of html syntax a little more

How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

  - It wasn't very difficult. The syntax is fairly easy to remember and putting it all together wasn't tedious at all. No extra research was necessary.

How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

  - I think my partner who was exceptional by the way and I, were able to keep to best practices without any issues. We knew the syntax and how to organize things properly and efficiently.

What seems good and bad about HTML?

  - As of right now, I am unable to pin point what is bad about HTML. Maybe later on I will as I use it more extensively. What seems to be good about HTML is that it is really easy to structure everything in a way that is pleasing to the eye.

What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

  - Unfortunately, I do not have any tricks. I have seen it many times over so I am a little more familiar with HTML. When I was learning it however, I used index cards and cheat sheets to remember the syntax and what different tags are used for.
