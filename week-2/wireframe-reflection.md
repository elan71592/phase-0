### What is a wireframe?
  - A wireframe is basically a mockup of your stripped down design of the site. It allows you to get a better understanding of how you want to lay out the content on your site before you get to graphically designing anything or adding colors.

### What are the benefits of wireframing?
  - There are many benefits to wireframing. Like any design, you start with a blueprint. These blueprints are there to help you lay out the site in the most basic possible way. If you try to dive right into it, you'll always run into problems and stumble with your design because you never had a clear idea and understanding of how and where you want everything.

### Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
  - I actually very much enjoyed wireframing my site. I enjoy a good challenge and since I'm not very good designing and things that require me to create visual presentations, my imagination runs wild but my skills aren't up to par with being able to actually create what is in my head. Below I am providing two wireframes I made. The first is my home page and the second is my blog page.

### Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
  - I revised my wireframe a few times throughout the process.

### What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
  - I haven't asked any questions. I kind of just went head on to see if I'd be able to get it done. No extra resources were used.

### Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
  - The most tedious part for me was trying to figure out which wireframe to go with. I built a couple but then ultimately stuck with the one I chose above because I have a vision for it.
