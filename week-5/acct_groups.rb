# Pseudocode
# Step 1: create method that takes array of names
# Step 2: create an index that will be used as a counter for a loop until it reaches the count of the array of names being passed in
# Step 3: create copy of array being passed in to delete elements from.
# Step 4: create group number counter
# step 5: loop through each name and add to a group but limit the group to 5 people unless there is not enough people at the end to make another group of at least 3. In that case, just add an extra person to the last group.

# Initial Solution:
# def acct_groups(names)
#   acct_groups = {}
#   names_list = Array.new(names)
#   int = 1
#   idx = 0

#   while idx != names.count
#     if acct_groups.empty?
#       acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s] = [names_list.sample]
#       names_list.delete(acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s][-1])
#     elsif acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s].count < 5
#       acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s] << names_list.sample
#       names_list.delete(acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s][-1])
#     else
#       if names_list.count == 2
#         if acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s].count == 5
#           acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s] << names_list.sample
#           names_list.delete(acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s][-1])
#           acct_groups["Group " + (int - 1).to_s] << names_list.sample
#           names_list.delete(acct_groups["Group " + (int - 1).to_s][-1])
#           break
#         end
#       elsif names_list.count == 1
#         if acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s].count == 5
#           acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s] << names_list.sample
#           names_list.delete(acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s][-1])
#         end
#         break
#       else
#         int += 1
#         acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s] = [names_list.sample]
#         names_list.delete(acct_groups["Group " + int.to_s][-1])
#       end
#     end
#     idx += 1
#   end

#   acct_groups.each do |group, people|
#       puts "#{group}: #{people}"
#     end
# end

#
#
#

# Refactored Solution:
def acct_groups(names)
  groups = []
  names.shuffle.each_slice(4) { |group| groups << group }
  idx = 1
  if groups[-1].count < 3
    groups[-1].each do |person|
      groups[-2] << person
    end
    groups.pop
  end
  groups.each do |group|
    puts
    puts "Group #{idx}: "
    group.each do |person|
      puts person
    end
    idx += 1
  end

acct_groups(names)

# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?

  # - The most interesting part was refactoring. The most difficult part was when I set my names_list variable = names. As my until loop was passing it would cut off at half the names and I overlooked that part. Took me some time but I got it. All I had to do was clone it so I did Array.new(names).shuffle and from there on, it was smooth sailing.

# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?

  # - I still don't have much patience for pseudocode but I am learning and I am getting better at breaking the problem down.

# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?

  # - I am not satisfied with my solution. It is a working solution that satisfies the task at hand but I am sure there is a much better way to do it and I haven't thought of it.

# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?

  # - I used a hash and an array. The hash was so I can set each group number corresponding to the array which contains each person for that group. I felt that having a hash would logically make more sense. If you have groups then why not put them in a data structure that works in key value pairs. The group numbers are the keys, the people in each group are the values. Just seemed logical to me but I could be very wrong.

# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?

  # - I did not learn any new Ruby methods while refactoring but I learned to look at my code more carefully. There were things there I didn't need in my initial solution which took up so much extra space and methods like shuffle and pop that came to me during refactoring which I guess is a good thing.
