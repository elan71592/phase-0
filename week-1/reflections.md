### Think About Time

  I learned various methods of time management that can be utilized such as meditation and creating habits, however the one that stood out to me the most is the section that regards tricks for getting into the zone. “Time Boxing” is a great strategy in my opinion for managing time and completing tasks efficiently. It creates this exciting atmosphere that’s especially great for building character and trust in teamwork (similar to the army but less guns haha). I have always been good at managing my time. My life is very structured due to my upbringing in the family business. I complete all tasks in a timely manner and always find certain parts throughout the day to just close my eyes and relax for a little bit before getting right back into it. I could employ some of these methods for sure as they’re all wonderful methods. Some aren’t for me and some are but currently I am very confident in my abilities to manage my time carefully and be consistent with what I put my mind to, therefore I will see how it goes using my methods and then should I need adjustments, I will begin with employing the methods I learned in the section about “getting into the zone”. My overall plan for Phase 0 is really to just be myself and try to get through as much as possible in a short amount of time. I like to set my goals high and my time short so I can push myself to the limit.

### The Command Line

  Shell is a basically an interpreter that makes things more efficient especially when navigating and manipulating files on the computer. Shell creates a direct interaction between you and the OS and when using shell, you demonstrate that you care for efficiency. Bash is another form of Shell. Nothing in this material was particularly challenging for me because I know these commands and have experience working with the command line. I use the command line and apply many of these commands practically every day. In my opinion, the following commands are very important just because of the repetition of them:



    cd

    ls

    mkdir

    rm and rm -r/rf

    rmdir

    cp

    touch



    I do remember what each of the commands do:



    pwd - print working directory

    ls - lists all the files/folders within the directory

    mv - moves a file

    cd - will always take you back to your home directory unless followed by a location

    ../ - will take you up one level or you can use as necessary. (../../../ if you want to go up 3 levels)

    touch - creates a file

    mkdir - makes a directory

    less - lets you look through a large file without being put all the way at the bottom. you’ll be able to scroll up and down page by page

    rmdir - removes a directory

    rm - removes a file

    help - explains a command


### Forking and Cloning

  If I had to write instructions for someone, I would say the following:



    1. To create a new repo, login to GitHub and click on the plus at the top right and then New Repository (It would be up to the person to decide on whether or not they want to add a license and make it public or private).

    2. To fork a repo, you must first go to the repo that you want to fork and then in the top right, below your profile pic, you will see 3 tabs next to each other. One will say Fork so click on it. Then click on your account because you want to fork it to yourself.

    3. To clone a repo, head on over to your repo or your forked repo and you should see above the file list to the right hand side a button that says Download Zip. To the left of it, you’ll see a link. It will either say HTTPS or SSH next to it. If you don’t have your SSH keys set up or don’t know what that is, make sure it says HTTPS then. Click on the link once and it will copy it automatically. Then open terminal and cd into the location of where you want to clone it to. Once there type git clone (paste url here).

  I didn’t have any issues setting up git. I set it up on multiple machines before and have used it so I’m familiar with it.
