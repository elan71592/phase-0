####Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

  First what you want to do is login to your GitHub account. If you don't have one, go to github.com and make one. Then once you're logged in, you should see a little plus symbol (+) at the top. Click that and then from the dropdown, click New Repository. Fill in the credentials you would like and then create it. Then once you create your repository, GitHub will take you to it. You should see a Download Zip button on the right side just above the file list. To the left of that button, you'll see a link with the words HTTPS or SSH next to it. You most likely do not have your ssh keys set up so make sure it says HTTPS. Then click on the link and it will automagically copy it for you. Then open terminal on your computer. First you want to check if you have git. To do that, type into terminal, git --version. If it shows you git version and then a number, you're good to go. Type git clone --paste the link here-- and hit return. Git will clone the repo for you. If you do not have Git then you must install it.

####Describe what open source means.

  Open Source means that the software is available for free and you are allowed to see how it was made and customize it however you want.

####What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

  I fight with myself on this. I know Open Source is great for the dev community and for poeple in general but I often think of the business aspect and how developers make things open source when they see very clearly that their software can be marketed and make a huge profit. One of my favorite open source programs is Kodi and I would sure as hell pay for it.At least a one time fee. It doesn't make me nervous but it does make me feel protective. I wouldn't want to make something I know that can be profitable, put it up for free, and then someone else comes along, views it, adjusts it, creates his own software based on mine and then makes a big profit, so there is some protectiveness I have about my ideas and what I will choose to make.

####Assess the importance of using licenses.

  Licenses allow others to help you with your project. Without a license, another user can't use, modify, or share the software.

####What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

  All of the concepts I have known already. I didn't have any struggles. Although, I assume that anything we will be making in DBC will have an MIT license.

####Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

  I did not
